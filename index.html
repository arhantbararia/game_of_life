      <h2>Welcome to Conway's Game of Life!</h2>
    </div>
    <p>This isn't just a game; it's a <strong>cellular automaton</strong>—a mesmerizing digital universe that evolves on its own. You're looking at a grid of cells, each one either alive or dead, that follow a few simple rules to create breathtakingly complex patterns.</p>
    
    <h3>The Rules of Life:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Birth:</strong> A dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</li>
      <li><strong>Survival:</strong> A live cell with two or three live neighbours survives to the next generation.</li>
      <li><strong>Death:</strong> In all other cases, a cell dies or remains dead. Overpopulation (more than three neighbours) or loneliness (fewer than two) are fatal.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>From these simple rules, astonishing structures can emerge some static, some oscillating, and some that travel across the grid like spaceships!</p>
    
    <p><strong>Ready to explore?</strong> Check out the presets in the dropdown menu to see some of the most famous and awe-inspiring creations discovered by mathematicians and enthusiasts. From the simple "Butterfly" to the intricate "Gosper Glider Gun" each one tells a unique story of emergence and complexity. Go on, give it a try! You can also draw your own.</p>
